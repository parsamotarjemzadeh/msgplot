# Telegram Chat Plot

This Python script analyzes your Telegram chat history and visualizes daily activity.

## How to Use

1. Export a Telegram chat (available only on Desktop).
2. Place the Python script in the exported chat folder.
3. Run the script:

Windows:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
Linux:
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py
```
After the first run in a chat folder, it creates a file named `allDates.txt` to speed up future runs.
